// The fees and foreign exchange rates that apply to the transaction.  If the fees are in terms of the `baseAmount` (source account) currency, then the effective rate is equal to **1 - (fees * `baseRate` / `baseAmount`)**.

In the preceding expressions, **fees** is equal to the sum of all `feeAmount.currencyAmount` values in the `fees` array.
