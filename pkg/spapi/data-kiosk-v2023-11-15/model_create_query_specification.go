// Information required to create the query.
type CreateQuerySpecification struct {
	// The GraphQL query to submit. A query must be at most 8000 characters after unnecessary whitespace is removed.
	Query string `json:"query"`
	// A token to fetch a certain page of query results when there are multiple pages of query results available. The value of this token must be fetched from the `pagination.nextToken` field of the `Query` object, and the `query` field for this object must also be set to the `query` field of the same `Query` object. A `Query` object can be retrieved from either the `getQueries` or `getQuery` operation. In the absence of this token value, the first page of query results will be requested.
