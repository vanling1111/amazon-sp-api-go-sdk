// AggregationTimePeriod : The supported aggregation time periods. For example, if FiveMinutes is the value chosen, and 50 price updates occur for an ASIN within 5 minutes, Amazon will send only two notifications; one for the first event, and then a subsequent notification 5 minutes later with the final end state of the data. The 48 interim events will be dropped.
