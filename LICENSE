Amazon SP-API Go SDK - Dual License
====================================

Copyright (c) 2025 Amazon SP-API Go SDK Contributors

This software is dual-licensed. You may choose either license:

---

## LICENSE OPTION 1: GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0)

### For Open Source Use

This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published
by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
(at your option) any later version.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the
GNU Affero General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License
along with this program. If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

### AGPL-3.0 Key Terms:

#### ‚úÖ You CAN (for free):
- Use this software for personal projects
- Use this software for educational purposes

#### üö® IMPORTANT - Network Copyleft:

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: I'm a solo developer. Do I need a commercial license?
**A:** Not if you're willing to open source your project under AGPL-3.0.
If you want to keep your code private, yes, you need a commercial license.

### Q: Can I use this for internal company tools?
**A:** Only with a commercial license. AGPL requires source disclosure even
for internal network services.

### Q: What if I modify the code?
**A:** Under AGPL-3.0, you must release your modifications. Under commercial
license, you can keep modifications private.

### Q: Can I distribute this as part of my product?
**A:** Only with a commercial license. AGPL would require your entire product
to be AGPL-3.0.

### Q: What about startups/non-profits?
**A:** Contact us - we offer discounted rates for startups and free licenses
for registered non-profits.

### Q: How do you enforce this?
**A:** We actively monitor usage and will pursue legal action against
unauthorized commercial use. The AGPL's network copyleft makes detection easier.

### Q: Can I try before buying?
**A:** Yes! Use under AGPL-3.0 for evaluation. Convert to commercial license
before production deployment.

### Why AGPL-3.0?

We chose AGPL-3.0 (not Apache 2.0 or MIT) because:

1. **Prevents Freeloading**: Cloud providers can't use our code to compete
   without contributing back
2. **Encourages Contribution**: If you improve it, the community benefits
3. **Fair Exchange**: Use for free if you give back, pay if you don't
4. **Strong Copyleft**: Ensures improvements remain open source
5. **Network Copyleft**: Closes the SaaS loophole (this is key!)

This model is used successfully by:
- MongoDB (Server Side Public License, similar concept)
- GitLab (MIT + Enterprise)
- Redis (SSPL for some modules)
- Elastic (Elastic License v2)
